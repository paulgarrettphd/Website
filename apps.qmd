# Descriptive RT/Accuracy Models

## Bernoulli–Weibull (shifted Weibull RT + Bernoulli accuracy)

**Why/when to use.**  
A simple, distribution-first description of RT with a flexible hazard (Weibull) and independent accuracy. Useful for baseline fits, pedagogy, and when you want a clean RT shape without commitment to a decision process.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Separable RT shape and accuracy; the Weibull can emulate increasing/decreasing hazard functions.

**Parameters (app).**
- `k` *(Weibull shape)* — Controls hazard: \(k<1\) decreasing, \(k=1\) exponential, \(k>1\) increasing.
- `λ` *(Weibull scale)* — Stretches RTs.
- `t0` *(non-decision)* — Pure shift (encoding/motor).
- `p` *(accuracy)* — Bernoulli success probability.

**Canonical refs.** @Weibull1951; distributional RT pedagogy @Luce1986.

## Poisson Counter (Gamma race)

**Why/when to use.**  
A discrete-event race: each response channel waits for \(N\) countable events at rate \(λ\). Good for illustrating race logic and how rate vs threshold shape RT/accuracy.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Closed-form Gamma finishing times; easy intuition: faster rate or lower \(N\) → faster responses.

**Parameters (app).**
- `N` *(threshold counts)* — Events required to finish (shape).
- `λ_c`, `λ_e` *(rates)* — Correct vs error channel event rates.
- `t0` *(non-decision)* — Additive shift.

**Canonical refs.** Race/counter models in @Luce1986; gamma-race for choice RT @Schwarz2001.

# Classic Sequential-Sampling Models

## Random Walk (discrete drift to fixed bounds)

**Why/when to use.**  
The pedagogical ancestor of diffusion models; shows stepwise accumulation to upper/lower bounds.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Transparent link between step bias/size and speed–accuracy trade-off.

**Parameters (app).**
- `p` *(step-up probability)* — Bias toward the upper bound.
- `h` *(step size)* — Evidence quantum per step.
- `a` *(bound)* — Decision threshold (0..a).
- `z/a` *(start proportion)* — Starting bias.
- `dt` *(step time)* — Temporal grain.

**Canonical refs.** @Stone1960; @Laming1968.

## Diffusion Decision Model (DDM; fixed bounds)

**Why/when to use.**  
The workhorse for 2AFC RT/accuracy; explains full distributions, accuracy, and their coupling.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Single-dimension continuous diffusion; clean parameter interpretability (drift = evidence quality, bound = caution).

**Parameters (app).**
- `v` *(drift)* — Mean evidence rate (quality/bias).
- `s` *(diffusion SD)* — Within-trial noise scale.
- `a` *(bound)* — Caution/threshold.
- `z/a` *(start bias)* — Starting point as fraction of `a`.

**Canonical refs.** @Ratcliff1978; tutorial review @RatcliffMcKoon2008.

## Wiener DDM with across-trial variability

**Why/when to use.**  
Realistic fits to skew/heavy-tail RTs by allowing trial-to-trial variation in start, drift, and non-decision.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Adds `sz`, `sv`, `st0` to capture over-dispersion without changing the within-trial process.

**Parameters (app).**
- `a, v, s, z/a, t0` — As above.
- `sz` *(start range)* — Uniform variability in `z`.
- `sv` *(drift SD)* — Gaussian variability in `v`.
- `st0` *(non-decision range)* — Uniform variability in `t0`.

**Canonical refs.** @RatcliffTuerlinckx2002.

## DDM with Hyperbolically Collapsing Bound(s)

**Why/when to use.**  
Time pressure/urgency: bounds that shrink over time allow “impatient” decisions with speedups at longer times.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Hyperbolic collapse \(a(t)=\max(a_{\min},a_0/(1+kt))\) approximates optimal policies under deadlines.

**Parameters (app).**
- `v, s` — As DDM.
- `a0` *(initial bound)* and `a_min` *(floor)*.
- `k` *(collapse rate)* — Urgency growth.
- `z/a0` *(start bias)* — Relative to `a0`.

# Leaky/Competing & Mean-Reverting Models

## Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA; 2 accumulators)

**Why/when to use.**  
When mutual inhibition and leakage matter (e.g., distractor suppression, competition).

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Two coupled SDEs with leak \(κ\) and lateral inhibition \(β\); rectification at 0 prevents negative activation.

**Parameters (app).**
- `v` *(target input)* and `(1−v)` *(competitor input)*.
- `s` *(noise SD)* — Within-trial noise.
- `b` *(bound)*, `a` *(max start)*.
- `kappa` *(leak κ)* — Pulls state toward 0.
- `beta` *(inhibition β)* — Cross-inhibition strength.
- `dt` *(step)*; `Max time` *(stop rule for plotting)*.

**Canonical refs.** @UsherMcClelland2001.

## Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) with fixed 0..a bounds

**Why/when to use.**  
Mean-reverting accumulation toward a set-point (\(μ\)). Useful for teaching mean reversion vs constant-drift diffusion.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Linear pull back to \(μ\); becomes DDM as \(θ\to0\).

**Parameters (app).**
- `θ` *(mean reversion rate)* — Strength of pull toward `μ`.
- `μ/a` *(set-point as proportion of a)*.
- `s` *(noise SD)*.
- `a`, `z/a`, `t0`, `dt` — As above.

**Canonical refs.** OU process @UhlenbeckOrnstein1930; decision applications @BusemeyerTownsend1993.

## LDLIV Dual-Race (state-dependent noise)

**Why/when to use.**  
A square-root diffusion (CIR type) where noise grows with the state, keeping \(X\ge 0\). Useful to illustrate multiplicative noise and positivity.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Each channel follows \(dX=(q-kX)\,dt+\sqrt{2\sigma X}\,dW\) and races to `b`.

**Parameters (app).**
- `b` *(bound)*.
- `q_c`, `q_e` *(inputs)* — Drive for each channel.
- `k` *(leak)* — Pull toward baseline.
- `σ` *(noise scale)* — Multiplies \(\sqrt{X}\).

**Canonical refs.** CIR process @Cox1985; multiplicative-noise decision variants reviewed in @Bogacz2006.

# Circular/Angular Models

## Circular Diffusion Model (vector 2D diffusion to a circle)

**Why/when to use.**  
Continuous-report/angle tasks: evidence drifts in 2D toward a direction and stops at a radius (choice angle = hit angle).

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Directly produces a response **angle** and RT jointly from a 2D diffusion with drift vector.

**Parameters (app).**
- `v` *(drift speed)* — Toward `θ`.
- `s` *(noise SD)* — Isotropic planar noise.
- `R` *(radius)* — Absorbing circle (decision bound).
- `θ (deg)` *(target angle)* — Direction of drift.

## SCDM: Sinusoidal Field to Bound (didactic variant)

**Why/when to use.**  
Pedagogical “population-tuning” view: a sinusoidal/von-Mises template over angle receives drift + noise; decision when the crest hits `b`.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Shows how **tuning sharpness** (κ) and **noise** shape the growth of a directional wave toward threshold.

**Parameters (app).**
- `v` *(drift amplitude)* — Scales the template drive.
- `s` *(noise SD)* — Additive field noise.
- `b` *(threshold)* — Circular bound in “activation space”.
- `κ` *(tuning)* — κ=0 → cosine; larger κ → sharper template.
- `M` *(angular bins)* — Discretisation of 0..2π.
- `θ (deg)` *(target angle)* — Template centre.
- `dt` *(integration step)*.

**Canonical refs.** Didactic; relates to population-tuning decision fields (see @Beck2008; orientation-tuned diffusion @Eckstein2011).

# Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) Family

## LBA (fixed bound)

**Why/when to use.**  
A deterministic-within-trial race model with across-trial variability only—fast, closed-form, transparent fits.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Ballistic linear growth from random starts and random drifts; no within-trial noise.

**Parameters (app).**
- `v` *(mean drift of correct channel)* — Evidence strength; error channel uses `1 − v` here (pedagogical 2-accumulator setup).
- `s` *(drift SD)* — Across-trial variability (truncated normal).
- `b` *(threshold)* — Common bound.
- `a` *(start max)* — Uniform start in \([0,a]\).

**Canonical refs.** @BrownHeathcote2008.

## LBA with Collapsing Bound

**Why/when to use.**  
Adds urgency to LBA via a linearly collapsing bound.

**What’s unique/useful.**  
Simple urgency mechanism with clear geometry: \(b(t)=\max(b_{\min}, b_0-kt)\).

**Parameters (app).**
- `v, s` — As LBA.
- `b0` *(initial bound)*, `b_min` *(floor)*.
- `k` *(collapse rate)*.
- `a` *(start max)*.

**Canonical refs.** Collapsing-bound LBA variants in @Hawkins2015; urgency modelling reviews in @Trueblood2014.

# Notes on Shared Concepts

- **Drift \(v\)**: mean evidence rate; ↑\(v\) → faster & more accurate (when sign aligned with “correct”).  
- **Bound \(a, b\)**: response caution; ↑bound → slower, more accurate.  
- **Start \(z\) or \(a\)-relative \(z/a\)**: a priori bias; nearer upper bound favours “correct” (in app’s mapping).  
- **Noise \(s\)**: within-trial variability (diffusion S.D.); across-trial variability handled by `sv, sz, st0` where applicable.  
- **Non-decision \(t_0\)**: encoding/motor time; shifts RT without changing accuracy.
